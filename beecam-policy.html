			it.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>(1) We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts
				with making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices
				regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and
				technical jargon to a minimum.</li>
			<li>(2) This Privacy Policy applies beginning May 25, 2018. The previous version of this Privacy Policy, will apply

		<h4>1. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</h4>
		<div>
			<p>This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by BeeCam. For
				simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To make it extra clear, we’ve added
				links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.</p>
			<p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own privacy policy,
				then that policy -- not this Privacy Policy -- applies.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="docitem">
		<h4>2. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h4>
		<h5>It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such
			as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information generated as you
			use our services, for example access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our
			services through a social media account. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.</h5>
		<div>
			<h6>1) Information you give us</h6>
			<p>You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credentials, as well as some basic details
					necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.</li>
				<li>When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your
					personality, lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos and videos. To
					add certain content, like pictures or videos, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album. Some of the
					information you choose to provide us may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain jurisdictions, for
					example your racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientation and religious beliefs. By choosing to provide this
					information, you consent to our processing of that information.</li>
				<li>When you subscribe to a paid service or make a purchase directly from us (rather than through a platform such
					as iOS or Android), you provide us or our payment service provider with information, such as your debit or credit
					card number or other financial information.</li>
				<li>When you participate in surveys or focus groups, you give us your insights into our products and services,
					responses to our questions and testimonials.</li>
				<li>When you choose to participate in our promotions, events or contests, we collect the information that you use
					to register or enter.</li>

					Sometimes, we monitor or record these interactions for training purposes and to ensure a high quality of service.</li>
				<li>If you ask us to communicate with or otherwise process information of other people (for example, if you ask us
					to send an email on your behalf to one of your friends), we collect the information about others that you give us
					in order to complete your request.</li>
				<li>Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as part of the
					operation of the services.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h6>2) Information we receive from others</h6>
			<p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others, including:</p>

				</li>
				<li><b>• Social Media</b>
					<p>You may be able to use your social media login (such as Facebook Login) to create and log into your Beecam account. This saves you from having to remember yet another user name and password and allows you to share
						some information from your social media account with us</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>• Other Partners</b>
					<p>We may receive info about you from our partners, for instance where Sweet Selfie ads are published on a
						partner’s websites and platforms (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success).</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>• Read the Contents of SD Card</b>
					<p>Read, Modify or delete the contents of your SD card as your instructions. We use this permission so that you
						can save new pictures to your SD card.</p>

					<p>When you use our services we may collect information about your location. With your consent, we may also
						collect information about your precise location using methods that include GPS, wireless networks, cell towers,
						Wi-Fi access points, and other sensors, such as gyroscopes, accelerometers, and compasses.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h6>3) Information collected when you use our services</h6>
			<p>When you use our services, we collect information about which features you’ve used, how you’ve used them and the
				devices you use to access our services. See below for more details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>• Usage Information</b>
					<p>We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g. date and time
						you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown to you, referring
						webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other users (e.g., users you connect
						and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of messages you send and receive).</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>• Device Information.</b>
					<p>We collect information about your device, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique
						device identifiers (including MAC address and IMEI), browser type and language, mobile device phone number, and
						mobile network information. We also collect certain device information that will help us diagnose problems in the
						(hopefully rare) event you experience any crash or other problem while using our Services. So, for example, if we
						detect a crash or other problematic event, we may collect the list of apps on your device and other information
						about your device’s performance at the time of the event for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>• Camera and Photos.</b>
					<p>Many of our services require us to collect images and other information from your device’s camera and photos.
						We’ll access your camera and photos only after you give us your consent.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="docitem">
		<h4>3. COOKIES AND OTHER SIMILAR DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGIES</h4>
		<p>Like most online services, we use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies. Cookies are small data files
			stored on your hard drive or in device memory that store information about your use of the Services, which
			authenticating you, remembering your preferences and settings, analyzing site traffic and trends, delivering and
			measuring the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, allowing you to use social features. Web beacons are small
			pieces of software on a webpage or email that help us see how you interact with that webpage or email. Most web
			browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove
			or reject browser cookies. Keep in mind, though, that removing or rejecting cookies could affect the availability
			and functionality of our Services.</p>
		<p>We use third-party analytics tools to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools
			collect information sent by your device or our Service, including the web pages you visit, add-ons, and other
			information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information with analytics
			information from other users so that it cannot reasonably be used to identify any particular individual User.</p>
		<p>And we use third-party advertising agencies to place advertisements on the Internet or in other media. To measure
			the effectiveness of the advertisements and determine how much to pay to the advertising agencies, we install
			third-party modules within the App. We may also install third-party modules within the App in order to help us
			understand how the Service is used.</p>
		<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) have a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature
			that tells a website that a user does not want to have his or her online activity tracked. If a website that
			responds to a DNT signal receives a DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain
			information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For
			this reason, many businesses, including BeeCam, do not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>

	<div class="docitem">
		<h4>6. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</h4>

	</div>
	<div class="docitem">
		<h4>7. YOUR RIGHTS</h4>

			processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your
			consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this data to another controller.</p>
		<p>In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we
			don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for
			direct marketing).</p>
		<p>These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another
			person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate
			interests in keeping.</p>
		<p>To exercise any of these rights, you can get in touch with us - or our data protection officer - using the details
			set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to an EU data protection authority

		<p>We work hard to protect you from unauthorized access to or alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal
			information. As with all technology companies, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise,
			and you should not expect, that your personal information will always remain secure.</p>
		<p>We regularly monitor our systems for possible vulnerabilities and attacks and regularly review our information
			collection, storage and processing practices to update our physical, technical and organizational security measures.</p>
		<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of
			security. If you believe that your account or information is no longer secure, please notify us immediately.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="docitem">

			months after this.</p>
		<p>Where we process personal data for marketing purposes or with your consent, we process the data until you ask us
			to stop and for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the
			fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your data so that we can respect your
			request in future.</p>
		<p>Where we process personal data in connection with performing a contract, we keep the transactional data for six
			years from your last interaction with us (or such longer period as may be required by law).</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that even though our systems are designed to carry out data deletion processes according to the above
			guidelines, we cannot promise that all data will be deleted within a specific time frame due to technical
			constraints.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="docitem">
